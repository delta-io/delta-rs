Certain queries can skip entire files based on the metadata.  File skipping can be a massive performance optimization.</p> <p>Delta Lake also makes it easy to rearrange data in the table, so more file skipping is possible.  For example, the table can be partitioned or Z Ordered, so that similar data is colocated in the same files and data skipping is optimal for your query patterns.</p> <p>For data lakes, you need to run file listing operations to get the file paths before you can actually read the data.  Listing all the files in a data lake can take a long time, especially if there are a lot of files and they are stored in Hive-style partitions.</p> <p>Delta Lake stores all the file paths in the transaction log.

CSV doesn't support any of these performance optimizations.</p> <p>Let's take a look at a sample dataset and run a query to see the performance enhancements offered by Delta Lake.</p> <p>Suppose you have a 1 billion row dataset with 9 columns, here are the first three rows of the dataset:</p> <pre><code>+-------+-------+--------------+-------+-------+--------+------+------+---------+\n| id1   | id2   | id3          |   id4 |   id5 |    id6 |   v1 |   v2 |      v3 |\n|-------+-------+--------------+-------+-------+--------+------+------+---------|\n| id016 | id046 | id0000109363 |    88 |    13 | 146094 |    4 |    6 | 18.8377 |\n| id039 | id087 | id0000466766 |    14 |    30 | 111330 |    4 |   14 | 46.7973 |\n| id047 | id098 | id0000307804 |    85 |    23 | 187639 |    3 |    5 | 47.5773 |\n+-------+-------+--------------+-------+-------+--------+------+------+---------+\n</code></pre> <p>The dataset is roughly 50 GB when stored as an uncompressed CSV files.

It runs out of memory if the <code>usecols</code> parameter is not set.</p> <p>Now let's convert the CSV dataset to Parquet and run the same query on the data stored in a Parquet file.</p> <pre><code>(\n    pd.read_parquet(\n        f\"{Path.home()}/data/G1_1e9_1e2_0_0.parquet\", columns=[\"id1\", \"id2\", \"v1\"]\n    )\n    .query(\"id1 == 'id016'\")\n    .groupby(\"id2\")\n    .agg({\"v1\": \"sum\"})\n)\n</code></pre> <p>This query takes 118 seconds to execute.</p> <p>Parquet stores data in row groups and allows for skipping when the <code>filters</code> predicates are set.

This was added to the <code>DeltaTable</code> class in version 0.9.0.  This command rearranges the small files into larger files which will reduce the number of files and speed up queries.</p> <p>This is very helpful for workloads that append frequently. For example, if you have a table that is appended to every 10 minutes, after a year you will have 52,560 files in the table. If the table is partitioned by another dimension, you will have 52,560 files per partition; with just 100 unique values that's millions of files. By running <code>optimize</code> periodically, you can reduce the number of files in the table to a more manageable number.</p> <p>Typically, you will run optimize less frequently than you append data. If possible, you might run optimize once you know you have finished writing to a particular partition. For example, on a table partitioned by date, you might append data every 10 minutes, but only run optimize once a day at the end of the day. This will ensure you don't need to compact the same data twice.</p> <p>This section will also teach you about how to use <code>vacuum</code> to physically remove files from storage that are no longer needed.

Users should sometimes repartition in memory before writing to disk to avoid appending files that are too small.</li> <li>Frequent appends: systems that append more often tend to append more smaller files.  A pipeline that appends every minute will generally generate ten times as many small files compared to a system that appends every ten minutes.</li> <li>Appending to partitioned data lakes with high cardinality columns can also cause small files.  If you append every hour to a table that\u2019s partitioned on a column with 1,000 distinct values, then every append could create 1,000 new files.  Partitioning by date avoids this problem because the data isn\u2019t split up across partitions in this manner.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"usage/optimize/small-file-compaction-with-optimize/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>This page showed you how to create a Delta table with many small files, compact the small files into larger files with optimize, and remove the tombstoned files from storage with vacuum.</p> <p>You also learned about how to incrementally optimize partitioned Delta tables, so you only compact newly added data.</p> <p>An excessive number of small files slows down Delta table queries, so periodic compaction is important.
