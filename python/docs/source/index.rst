Python deltalake package
=========================================================

This is the documentation for the native Python implementation of deltalake. It
is based on the delta-rs Rust library and requires no Spark or JVM dependencies.
For the PySpark implementation, see `delta-spark`_ instead.

This module provides the capability to read, write, and manage `Delta Lake`_
tables from Python without Spark or Java. It uses `Apache Arrow`_ under the hood,
so is compatible with other Arrow-native or integrated libraries such as
Pandas_, DuckDB_, and Polars_.

.. note::

   This module is under active development and some features are experimental.
   It is not yet as feature-complete as the PySpark implementation of Delta
   Lake. If you encounter a bug, please let us know in our `GitHub repo`_.
