An experimental interface to
link:https://delta.io[Delta Lake]
for Rust.

This library is intended to be used either directly within Rust (see link:https://github.com/rajasekarv/vega[vega], etc)  or act as the basis for native bindings in other languages such as Python, Ruby, or Golang.

**This project is still very early and only _read_ operations are supported at the moment**.
