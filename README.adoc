An experimental interface to
link:https://delta.io[Delta Lake]
for Rust.

This library provides low level access to Delta tables and is intended to be
used with data processing frameworks like
link:https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/datafusion[datafusion],
link:https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista[ballista],
link:https://github.com/nevi-me/rust-dataframe[rust-dataframe],
link:https://github.com/rajasekarv/vega[vega], etc.

It can also act as the basis for native bindings in other languages such as Python, Ruby or Golang.

**This project is still very early and only _read_ operations are supported at the moment**.
