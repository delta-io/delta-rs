== About

This library provides low level access to Delta tables in Rust, which can be
used with data processing frameworks like
link:https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/datafusion[datafusion],
link:https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista[ballista],
link:https://github.com/nevi-me/rust-dataframe[rust-dataframe],
link:https://github.com/rajasekarv/vega[vega], etc. It also provides bindings to other higher level languages such as link:https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/python/[Python], Ruby, or Golang.

== Get Involved

Join link:https://dbricks.co/delta-users-slack[#delta-rs in the Delta Lake Slack workspace]

=== Development Meeting

We have a standing development sync meeting for those that are interested. The meeting is held every two weeks at **9am PST** on Tuesday mornings. The direct meeting URL is shared in the Slack channel above :point_up: before the meeting.

These meetings are also link:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSKhDO79MNcX4pIIRFD0UVg[streamed live via YouTube] if you just want to listen in.

=== Development

delta-rs requires the Rust compiler, which can be installed with the
link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup]
command.

Running tests can be done with `cargo test` in the root directory, or one of the directories below:

=== Rust

The `rust/` directory contains core Rust APIs for accessing Delta Lake from Rust, or for higher-level language bindings.

=== Python

The `python/` directory contains the `deltalake` Python package built on top of delta-rs

=== Ruby

The `ruby/` directory contains an early prototype of a Ruby library built on top of delta-rs
